# 🚗 Car Sales Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

This project performs an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **Car Sales dataset** to understand sales patterns, vehicle characteristics, pricing behavior, and key business drivers influencing automobile sales.

The analysis focuses on transforming raw car sales data into **actionable insights** that can support **business decision-making**, pricing strategies, and market understanding.
